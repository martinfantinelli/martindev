## Hello

My name is Martin and I am a software engineer. I have been working in the industry for over 4 years and have experience in developing applications using various technologies such as Java with Spring Boot, Node.js, and TypeScript. I am also interested in exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

What drives me is the opportunity to solve complex problems through elegant code and innovative thinking. With a results-oriented mindset, I embrace continuous learning to stay ahead in ever-evolving technological landscapes.

My commitment to excellence extends beyond professional projectsâ€”I actively develop mobile applications and explore artificial intelligence and information security in my personal time, ensuring my skills remain sharp and future-ready.

I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to transformative projects, helping organizations leverage technology to achieve their strategic objectives.


## What are you going to see here?

My intention is to share my experiences and knowledge with you. I'll cover topics such as my journey in the industry, the technologies I am currently working with, and the challenges I have faced. I'll also provide insights into my philosophy on software development, such as the open source movement and the importance of working collaboratively, and more importantly, the impact of technology on society.
For last but not least, for each post I'll try to share some random references about what I am reading, listening, watching. It can be anything that I like so you can know more about me beside my professional life.
